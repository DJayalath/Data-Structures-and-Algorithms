// MVC pattern is mainly used for user interfaces (JavaFX uses MVC)

// User -- USES --> Controller -- MANIPULATES --> Model -- UPDATES --> View -- SEEN BY -> User

// The model is the application's dynamic data structure
// The view is the presentation of the model as seen by the user
// The controller responds to user input and manipulates the model

public class ModelViewController {
    
}
